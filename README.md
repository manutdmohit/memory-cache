# Express.js Caching Middleware

This is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates how to implement caching in an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) application using the `memory-cache` package. Caching is a technique used to store and serve frequently requested data to reduce response times and server load.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/).

Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```
   node app.js
   ```

This will start the Express.js server, and you should see a message in the console indicating that the server is running on port 3000.

## Usage

The application demonstrates caching using a middleware function (`cacheMiddleware`) that is applied to all routes. Here's how it works:

- The `cacheMiddleware` function checks if the response for the current request URL is already cached.
- If cached data is found, it serves the cached response to the client, reducing response time.
- If no cached data is found, it temporarily overrides the `res.send` method to cache the response for the next 10 seconds and then proceeds to generate the response.

In the provided `/data` route, we simulate an expensive operation by delaying the response for 2 seconds. The data is then sent as "Data from the server."

## Customization

You can customize this application by:

- Adding more routes and applying the `cacheMiddleware` to them.
- Adjusting the caching time (currently set to 10 seconds) to meet your specific requirements.
- Modifying the route handlers to return different data or perform various operations.
